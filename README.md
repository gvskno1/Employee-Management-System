# Employee Management System (Core Java)

A console-based Employee Management System built using Core Java to demonstrate
object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, method
overriding, and clean layered architecture.

## Features
- Add employees (Full-Time and Contract)
- Display all employee details
- Calculate salaries using runtime polymorphism
- Clean separation of model, service, and application layers

## Concepts Covered
- Inheritance and Method Overriding
- Runtime Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Collections (List)
- Iterator-safe operations
- toString() overriding
- Clean package structuring

## Tech Stack
- Java (Core)
- Eclipse IDE

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Import as a Java project in Eclipse
3. Run `EmployeeApp.java`

## Sample Output
Employee [id=1, name=Sai, baseSalary=50000.0]
Employee [id=2, name=Raj, baseSalary=0.0]

Employee ID: 1, Name: Sai, Salary: 60000.0
Employee ID: 2, Name: Raj, Salary: 48000.0

## Future Enhancements
- Java Streams & Lambda refactor
- File persistence
- Spring Boot REST API version
